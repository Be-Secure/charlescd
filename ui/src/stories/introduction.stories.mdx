# CharlesCD's UI components documentation
<br/>
<br/>

## Overview

UI components are the building blocks to compose a user interface. With this documentation, we want to
facilitate visualization of existing components.<br/>
Note: Before you create a new component, please verify if there is one that already works for what you need.

## How to use

You can browse through the components in the sidebar, and click on `show code` to see its usage. Also the props of
each component are shown.
