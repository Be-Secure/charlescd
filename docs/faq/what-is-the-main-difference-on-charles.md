# What is the main difference on Charles?

Unlike other ways of deploy, Charles allows developers to realize simultaneous segmentation and agroupment of user with circles.   
  
With the tool, the delivery process in traditionals environments occurs in longer frequencies - weekly, biweekly or even monthly - gains a new rhythm. The feedback cycle of your product becomes more faster and effective, which means that you can manage your timing in a way more intelligent and assertive. 

Besides, developers will be more encouraged to innovate and to make more implementations of new versions, once that identifying bugs is easier and creating circles helps on minimizing the error budget.
